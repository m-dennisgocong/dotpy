dotpy is an IDE application for Python 3, build using Tkinter GUI toolkit. This project is inspired by Python IDLE also written in Python and Tkinter GUI toolkit.

## Features include:

- Creating new file, opening existing file, editing and saving file.
- Open Folder/Project, show/hide the list of the opened folder/project and able to select or open a file from the list.

- Implementing common editing option such as cut,past,undo,redo, clear all and select all.
